**Technical Aspects**
As per requirement developed by using javascript
Dom manipulation can be very costyly based on number of elements.
keep this i treid the approach of copying the existing nodes/elements
and perform action on copied elements.replaced same at the end.
so in this case we are only doing 1 dom manipulation per click.
